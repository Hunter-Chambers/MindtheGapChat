Overview and Inspiration:
    Mind the Gap Chat is a simple chat app that lets users
    connect to a chat room hosted on thor and discuss
    anything and everything together. We wanted to create
    an app that brings everyone from this specific community
    of WT Computer Science engineers together and allow us
    to connect in a simple way.

Google Drive Layout:
    APK_Installer/
        This directory holds the MindtheGapChat.apk file that
        you can install directly to any Android device.

    Development_Files/
        This directory holds all of our Android Studio
        development files. You can simply import the MindtheGapChat/
        directory into Android Studio to see our project files.

    Server_Scripts/
        This directory holds all of the scripts that handle the server.

NOTE:
    The server script MindtheGapChat.py must be running before
    connecting the Android device from the app. The script must
    also be run on thor. All server script files must be in the
    same directory.
